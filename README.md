# Overview

A small docker lighttpd alpine:latest to host simple statick files.

Does not currently have https support turned on, although it exposes port 443 and you can modify the config if you want.

# Usage:
<pre>
docker run -it kiwichrish/alpine_lighttpd
</pre>

Will ping up a very basic test.
